## notes:

`~/`			navigate you to your home directory
`ls`			list out everything (Helps to find out where you R)
`ls -la`			lists out everything in detail
`mkdir`			creates new folders
`cd`			navigate into <name of the directory>
`touch`			creates a new file
`rm -rf`	<name> 	it deletes anything hahaha
`git status`  check the status of git
`git add`     add item for git to start tracking or monitoring for changes (pass in the name of the files that you want to add) `git add <name of file>` or `git add *`
`git commit -m "add all files"` most important line because this is when git is actually adding the files or changes you have made.
